fluorescence is a free, customizable client for Ultima Online. <br />
It is designed to give freeshard creators more power to customize their world.

The project is in an early development stage. You can connect to a server and do a few things (walking around, speech, targets, clicking, interact with gump menus, ...), but please do not expect a fully playable Ultima Online client yet.
A preview release is available in the downloads section.

Next features on the ToDo list:
  * Corpses
  * Buy/Sell
  * Hue picker
  * Party code
